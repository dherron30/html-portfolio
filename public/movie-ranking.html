<h3> Inside Out 2</h3>
<p>I have recently watched this movie and thought the animation and message was beautiful</p>
<h3> Lion King</h3>
<p> Beautiful African music and the movie adapts the play Hamlet but with Lion's in a pride</p>
<h3> Find Guy</h3>
<p> Ryan Reynolds was really funny and it is a cool way to look at computer games. </p>
